# [Social Graph Analyzer](https://github.com/HassanDawy/Facebook-Graph-Analysis)

### **Project Overview**
This project implements high-performance graph algorithms in **Rust** to analyze real-world social network structures. By processing Facebook ego graph data, it identifies key influencers, measures network connectivity, and uncovers community clusters.

---

### **Key Features**
* **Path Analysis**: Utilizes **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to calculate average path distances across the network.
* **Influence Mapping**: Computes **Closeness Centrality** to pinpoint the most "central" or influential nodes.
* **Similarity Scoring**: Implements **Jaccard Similarity** based on mutual friends to identify closely linked user groups.
* **Rust-Powered**: Built entirely with [Rust](https://github.com/HassanDawy/Facebook-Graph-Analysis/search?l=rust) for safety and efficiency when handling large-scale graph datasets.
